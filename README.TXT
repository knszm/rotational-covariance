Description: This repository contains supplemental material to the article "Rotational covariance restricts available quantum states" by Fynn Otto and Konrad Szyma≈Ñski. The files include:
- Calculations relevant to Section V and Appendix F, including derivation of the U(1) characteristic function and metrological properties of the extracted states (squeezed-extraction.nb and the static rendered squeezed-extraction.pdf).
- Examples of calculation of the polynomial parameterization of SU(2) representations (Section IIIA) and semidefinite optimization relevant to Example 2 (su2-poly-example.nb and the static rendered su2-poly-example.pdf).
- Maximal attainable fidelity calculations with semidefinite optimization techniques in Section IVB (fidelity_calculations.ipynb).
